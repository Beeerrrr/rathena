# Branch Management Strategy for rAthena + Chaos Integration
# Optimized workflow for maintaining upstream sync while developing custom features

strategy:
  overview: |
    Two-branch system designed to maintain clean separation between upstream rAthena 
    code and custom Chaos modifications while enabling efficient development workflow.

branches:
  main:
    purpose: "Stable upstream sync point"
    description: "Clean mirror of rAthena/rAthena repository"
    rules:
      - "Never commit directly to main"
      - "Only merge from upstream rAthena"
      - "Must remain identical to upstream"
      - "Protected branch with required reviews"
    
    update_process:
      frequency: "Weekly or on important releases"
      steps:
        - "git checkout main"
        - "git pull upstream master"
        - "Verify no conflicts with Chaos branch"
        - "Push to origin/main"
        - "Trigger Chaos branch update"
    
    monitoring:
      - "Track upstream commits"
      - "Identify breaking changes"
      - "Test compatibility with Chaos features"
      - "Document merge conflicts"

  chaos:
    purpose: "Custom development and optimizations"
    description: "Main development branch with Chaos-specific enhancements"
    base: "main branch (regularly rebased/merged)"
    
    features:
      performance:
        - "Multi-level caching system"
        - "Database query optimization"
        - "Memory pool enhancements"
        - "Inter-server communication improvements"
        
      development:
        - "Enhanced debugging tools"
        - "Performance monitoring"
        - "Automated testing framework"
        - "Development utilities"
        
      gameplay:
        - "Custom game mechanics"
        - "Enhanced NPC scripting"
        - "New item/skill systems"
        - "Player experience improvements"
        
      infrastructure:
        - "Docker containerization"
        - "CI/CD pipeline"
        - "Automated backups"
        - "Health monitoring"
    
    workflow:
      development_cycle: |
        1. Create feature branch from Chaos
        2. Develop and test feature
        3. Create pull request to Chaos
        4. Code review and testing
        5. Merge to Chaos after approval
        
      upstream_sync: |
        1. Fetch latest from main branch
        2. Create merge/rebase branch
        3. Resolve conflicts prioritizing Chaos features
        4. Test all systems work together
        5. Merge to Chaos after validation

sync_strategy:
  frequency: "Weekly upstream sync + immediate for critical updates"
  
  conflict_resolution:
    priority_order:
      1: "Security fixes (always take upstream)"
      2: "Performance optimizations (merge carefully)"  
      3: "Chaos custom features (maintain custom logic)"
      4: "Code organization (prefer Chaos structure)"
    
    resolution_process:
      - "Identify conflict type and impact"
      - "Apply priority rules"
      - "Test merged result thoroughly"
